## LSTM Trading Agent Overview

This section introduces the core of our project: the LSTM Trading Agent. This sophisticated machine learning model leverages the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to analyze time-series data and make informed trading decisions.

### What is an LSTM?

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, a type of artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTMs have feedback connections and memory cells that allow them to process not just single data points, but also entire sequences of data. For trading, this means LSTMs can take into account the temporal sequence of market data, which is essential for capturing the nuances of market dynamics.

### How the LSTM Trading Agent Works

Our LSTM Trading Agent operates by taking in a sequence of historical price data as input and predicting future price movements. The agent is trained on a dataset that includes several features, such as opening and closing prices, trading volume, and other technical indicators that are relevant to the market being analyzed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the agent's workflow:
